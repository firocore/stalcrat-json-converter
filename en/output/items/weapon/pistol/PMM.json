  "discription": "This upgraded PM differs in terms of its increased magazine and improved reliability. The maximum pressure in the pistol’s barrel has been increased, which has improved its stopping power. Its disadvantages include its short range and low accuracy, and also its increased recoil by comparison with the PM and the increased spring tension in the magazine, which can lead to a loss of elasticity in the spring and cause delays while firing."
