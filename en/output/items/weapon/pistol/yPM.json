  "discription": "The most widely used pistol in the Zone, the PM is a vestige of the Soviet era. It is one of the best examples of the compact self-defense weapon class. It stands out due to its small dimensions, superb reliability, simplicity of use, and ease of maintenance. Among its downsides are its low range and accuracy, the limited effectiveness of its bullets, and (by comparison with other modern pistols in the same class) its relatively substantial weight and poor clip capacity."
