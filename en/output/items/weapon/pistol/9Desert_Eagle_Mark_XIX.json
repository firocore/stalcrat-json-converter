  "discription": "A true pocket cannon, this weapon is large and heavy and possesses extremely high stopping power. It was developed as a specialized weapon for hunting medium-sized and large animals, and also for shooting sports using silhouette targets at a range of over 50 meters. Due to its price, weight, and huge dimensions, it has never been widely used in the Zone."
