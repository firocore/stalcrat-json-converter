  "discription": "An assault rifle developed in the USA based on the M16A2, first intended for use by armed crews of combat vehicles and technical crews. In the present day, the entire US army is switching over to use the M4A1. The increased ease of use of a shorted carbine in modern conditions, when the majority of the army is made up of mechanized infantry, crews of combat vehicles and auxiliary troops, more than makes up for the fairly insignificant reduction in stats compared to a regular rifle."
