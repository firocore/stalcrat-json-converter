  "discription": "A submachine gun developed in the mid-1990s by members of the Special Design Bureau at the Kovrov Mechanical Plant. The Austrian Steyr MPi-69 was used as a model, but after releasing a test run of AEK-919s, some flaws were discovered that led to changes to the base design. The updated model was given the index AEK-919K."
