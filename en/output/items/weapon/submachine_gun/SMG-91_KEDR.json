  "discription": "The SMG-91 KEDR (designed by Yevgeny Dragunov) is a submachine gun developed in the early 1990s, on orders from the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the USSR. It was based on an earlier SMG-71, also designed by Dragunov. The first 40 preproduction prototypes were made in 1992 at the Izhevsk Mechanical Plant. Mass production began in 1993, at the Zlatoust Machine-Building Plant."
