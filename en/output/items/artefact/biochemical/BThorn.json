  "discription": "An artifact that forms inside the Burnt Fuzz anomaly. In appearance it resembles a rusty sphere with needles. If worn, it slowly but effectively cleanses the body of radiation. The artifact affects the tissues of the blood vessels, and as a side effect, they become thinner, which increases the risk of bleeding when injured."
