  "discription": "The gas produced by the artifact both makes the ownerâ€™s tissues coarser and stimulates their organ systems after injury. However, when under the effects of the artifact, movement requires more effort. Some believe that the artifact is a Shell that fell into a Vortex and eventually lost all its electric charge."
